            <h1>What is Coronavirus?</h1>
            <p>Coronaviruses are a type of virus. There are many different kinds, and some cause disease. A newly identified coronavirus, SARS-CoV-2, has caused a worldwide pandemic of respiratory illness, called COVID-19. What You Need to Know</p>
            <p>As of now, researchers know that the new coronavirus is spread through droplets released into the air when an infected person coughs or sneezes. The droplets generally do not travel more than a few feet, and they fall to the ground (or onto surfaces) in a few seconds — this is why physical distancing is effective in preventing the spread.</p>

            <p>Older adults and people who have certain underlying conditions like heart or lung disease or diabetes are at increased risk of severe illness from COVID-19 illness.</p>
            <p>COVID-19 spreads easily from person to person, mainly by the following routes:</p>
            <ul>
                <li>Between people who are in close contact with one another (within 6 feet).</li>
                <li>Through respiratory droplets produced when an infected person coughs, sneezes, breathes, sings or talks.</li>
                <li>People who are infected but do not have symptoms can also spread the virus to others.
